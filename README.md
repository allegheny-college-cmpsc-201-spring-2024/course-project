# CMPSC 201: Creating a code golfing language

This project branch contemplates creating a code golfing language. While we've had experience creating a programming language _and_ code golfing, 
there hasn't been too much consideration of what it would look like to create a language specifically tailored to the cybersport. Thankfully,
there are a number of helpful resources:

* [Introduction to Code Golf and Golflangs](https://blog.vero.site/post/golf)
* [Tips for Creating/Maintaining a Golfing Language](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/198446/tips-for-creating-maintaining-a-golfing-language)
* [Tips for launching a language](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14927/tips-for-launching-a-language)
* [Choosing Languages for Golfing](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/2070/choosing-languages-for-golfing)

From the main project `README`:

> Much in the tradition of languages such as CJam, Jelly, J, APL, and others! Discussion of desirable features may help students pursing this path 
> to determine the predominate features they'd like to include in their language. The true test: can your language solve all of the holes that we've 
> completed as part of our ACGA challenge?

## Requirements

* the language must have a name
* store the language's source code in the `src` folder
* the language developed must be capable enough to solve all of the semester's code golf challenges
  * store programs in the `examples` folder
* [documentation](docs/reflection.md) must be complete
