# CMPSC 201: Reimplementing the `Lox` language

Completing this project involves reimplementing _all_ of the `Lox` language in another language. There exists a running list
of various reimplementations maintained by @munificent here:

* [List of `Lox` reimplementations](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/wiki/Lox-implementations)

While you may choose a language in which `Lox` is already implemented, you're challenged to embrace a language in which there isn't already a full work-up
in order to pioneer a path forward for `Lox`! If choosing to implement the language in one not in the above-linked list, you'll recieve a 10% boost to your
course grade if your experiment is successful.

From the broader `README`:

> This course implemented the `Lox` language using Java, the key word in the sentence being _implemented_; `Lox` proposes a set of rules that can
> be implemented in many other languages. Java is the choice that our textbook's author made. Readers of _Crafting Interpreters_ [have ported the language
> to a wide variety of other languages](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/wiki/Lox-implementations) -- even `Lox` itself!
>
> Students are invited to tacle this challenge by choosing a language in which they'd like to implement `Lox`, including those in which there're already
> implementations. However, for an extra challenge, students might consider using:
> 
> * Aya
> * Jactl
> * Lark
>
> or any other language in which there's not currently an active implementation. If students complete an implementation in an unrepresented language,
> they might earn an entry on the `Lox` wiki!
>
> This project will be evaluated by its ability to run a novel program written in the `Lox` language.

## Requirements

* the language must have a name
* store the language's source code in the src folder (or language ecosystem appropriate structure)
* the language must solve the novel program in `examples/main.lox`
* [documentation](docs/reflection.md) must be complete
